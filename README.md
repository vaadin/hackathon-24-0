# hackathon-24-0
This project is a simple application where a shop owner creates invoice and on creation of every invoice, an embedded sales distribution chart changes depending on the total sale amount in that hour. 
The application loads a spreadsheet with a chart in it. Initial values for the chart are 0. 
The spreadsheet has two Button components added to it, one to create a new invoice and the other to export the spreadsheet with all the data. The button opens a dialog on click, where there are input text fields and also a GridPro editor to add the products purchased. 

## Running the application
The project is a standard Maven project.Run the application and open http://localhost:8080/shop in browser.

## Application Demo
check the demo.docx for the demo of the application.
